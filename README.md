# doodlejoel-game
Web game developed using TypeScript and HTML in Visual Studio Code during the HACK110 hackathon

Title: 
Doodle Joel 

Description: 
The objective of the game is to keep Joel Berry from falling off the screen or hitting one of the basketballs sliding across the screen. Using Joel Berry's icon, the player tries to keep jumping on the islands on the court. Once Joel falls all the way down the court or get hit by Grayson's baksetball, you lose the game. The goal is to get as many points as possible, where one jump on a log equals one point. 

Team Members: 
Isha Kabra, Akshay Iyengar

COMP 110 Programming Concepts Used: 
If-Then-Else statements, For Loops, Object-Oriented Programming 

Challenges Overcome / New Concepts Learned: 
We learned how to implement object-oriented programming and constructors, especially when creating Sprite objects for each icon, as well as using HTML to create a web-based game. Challenges we overcame included making the islands move and reappear at a constant rate, making the player keep jumping at a decent speed when he touched a log, and displaying the message after the game ended that counted up the points of the game.

Individual Contributions to Project: 

Isha - Positioning Joel, Grayson, and the moving basketballs and logs using for loops and if statements; creating classes for the log and basketball; implementing the logic for the program to detect when icons collided 

Akshay - Visual creations of islands and court, completing some of the loops and if-statements for when the game ended, creating the message box to display at the end that showed the score 

Goals Achieved: 
We were able to make the game similar to Doodle Jump, which was our original goal. The game ultimately worked and we were able to effectively make Joel, the logs, and the basketballs move at decent rates. We were also able to count up the points that the player accumulated by jumping on logs and then display the score when the program detected that the player lost the game, which happened when Joel collided with a basketball or missed logs and fell off the screen. 

Goals Outstanding / Future Work: 
Additional features that could be implemented include adding more enemy players, making Joel Berry's movement more smooth, making the game more like Doodle Jump, and adding in lives.
